1.Write a blog about difference between document and window object.

Document object:
•	JavaScript Document object is an object that provides access to all HTML elements of a document. When an HTML document is loaded into a browser window, then it becomes a document object
•	It is a programming interface that allows us to create, change, or remove elements from the document. 
•	We can also add events to these elements to make our page more dynamic.

Window object:
•	It represents the browser's window. All global JavaScript objects, functions, and variables automatically become members of the window object.
•	Window is the object of browser, it is not the object of javascript. The javascript objects are string, array, date etc.

Difference between document and object model:
1.Window object is the top most object and outermost element of the object hierarchy.
   Each HTML document that gets loaded into a window becomes a document object. The document contains the contents of the page. Using document object, JavaScript can modify, add and delete the HTML elements, attributes CSS styles in the page

2. The window object represents a window/tab containing a DOM document where as document object is property of window object that points to the DOM document loaded in that window.

3. The other major difference is that both window object and document object have properties and methods. 
   Few method names are same in both objects but with different behavior.
